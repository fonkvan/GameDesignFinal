# GameDesignFinal
This is a level I created for my beginner level game design class. In the class we used Unreal Engine 4, and learned about landscapes, landscape materials, lighting, sound, particle effects, blueprints, cameras, and many other things. Assets are all off of the Marketplace, though there are a couple of original particle effects (such as a particle effect for flies, and a particle effect for blood dripping), but I did the landscape, and asset placement, posing of the dead body in the basement using an animation, placed decals, and added sound effects all on my own. The goal was to create a level that was somewhat spooky like a Resident Evil game.
